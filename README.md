**LLM Classification Finetuning**
Finetune LLMs to Predict Human Preference using Chatbot Arena conversations

This competition challenges you to predict which responses users will prefer in a head-to-head battle between chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs). 
You'll be given a dataset of conversations from the Chatbot Arena, where different LLMs generate answers to user prompts. By developing a winning machine learning model, 
you'll help improve how chatbots interact with humans and ensure they better align with human preferences.
